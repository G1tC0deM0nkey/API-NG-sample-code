Betfair API-NG Code Samples
===============================

This GitHub repository contains sample code in various languages to help customers get started with writing Betfair API clients. 
For more information about Betfair API please see  [Getting started](https://betfair-developer-docs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/pages/2687786/Getting+Started) and [developer.betfair.com](http://developer.betfair.com).

Please note, these are not intended to be fully fledged clients, and all follow an identical set of scenarios. As a result, we do not wish to extend the samples with pull requests that extend only a single language sample or add functionality not in the below scen

Each of the basic language samples demonstrates a basic use case of placing a bet on the next GB Horse Racing market:

* Find the next UK Horse Racing Win market
* Get prices for the market
* Place a bet on the market 
* Handle the error returned by the API when the bet fails as it is below the minimum stake size.

For the sake of simplicity and ease of understanding, these samples are not intended to show best practice for optimisations for speed or throughput. 

A comprehensive description of the samples can be found in the [Sample Code, Client Libraries & Tutorials](https://betfair-developer-docs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/pages/2687537/Sample+Code).

The sample code is not intended to be used as-is in a production environment and carries no assurances or guarantees.
